cryptography has as fundamental objective to enable two people usually referred to as
alice and bob to communicate over an insecure channel in such a way that an opponent oscar
cannot understand what is being said this channel could be for example a telephone line
or computer network the information that alice wants to send to bob which is called
plain text can be english text numerical data or anything at all alice encrypts the
plain text using a predetermined key and sends the resulting cipher text over the channel
oscar upon seeing the cipher text in the channel by eavesdropping cannot determine what
the plain text was but bob who knows the encryption key can decrypt the cipher text and
reconstruct the plain text with relatively little effort the next quiz uses permutation
and it is known that the text fits perfectly in a rectangular area where the number of rows
is greater than the number of columns it is also known that the word banana appears several
times in the text
